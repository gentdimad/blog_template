React has evolved significantly. In 2026, building components is more intuitive than ever.

## Why React?

React's component-based architecture allows for:
- Reusable UI elements
- Fast updates via the Virtual DOM
- Strong community support

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, Future Developer!</h1>;
}
```

Start by setting up your environment with Vite for the fastest development experience.
