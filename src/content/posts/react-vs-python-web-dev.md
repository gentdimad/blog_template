# The Developer's Dilemma

Should you start with the frontend (React) or the backend (Python)?

## The Case for React

If you love visual feedback and building interactive user experiences, React is for you.

## The Case for Python

If you prefer logic, data processing, and building the "brains" behind the scenes, Python is the way to go.

### Summary Table

[table]
Feature | React (JavaScript) | Python
Primary Use | UI/Frontend | Logic/Backend/AI
Learning Curve | Medium | Easy (syntax-wise)
Market Demand | Very High | Very High
[/table]

Ultimately, great developers often learn both!
